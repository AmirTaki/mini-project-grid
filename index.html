                " Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn proframming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program.
            The entire curriculum an staff id not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outsatning. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've ofter referred to it durng interviews as an example of my  developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiveng multiple offers. 100% recmmend! "
